      <td  valign="top"><b>RFC</b><br>4.6.1.  Key Pair Generation and Installation<br> <br> Key pair generation and installation need to be considered for the issuing CA, repositories, subject CAs, RAs, and subscribers.  For  each of these types of entities, the following questions potentially need to be answered:
      <ol>
        <li>Who generates the entity public, private key pair?  Possibilities include the subscriber, RA, or CA.  Also, how is the key generation performed?  Is the key generation performed by hardware or software?</li>
        <li>How is the private key provided securely to the entity? Possibilities include a situation where the entity has generated it and therefore already has it, handing the entity the private key physically, mailing a token containing the private key securely, or delivering it in an SSL session.</li>
        <li>How is the entity's public key provided securely to the certification authority?  Some possibilities are in an online SSL session or in a message signed by the RA.</li>
        <li>In the case of issuing CAs, how is the CA's public key provided securely to potential relying parties?  Possibilities include handing the public key to the relying party securely in person, physically mailing a copy securely to the relying party, or delivering it in a SSL session.</li>
        <li>What are the key sizes?  Examples include a 1,024 bit RSA modulus and a 1,024 bit DSA large prime.</li>
        <li>Who generates the public key parameters, and is the quality of the parameters checked during key generation?</li>
        <li>For what purposes may the key be used, or for what purposes should usage of the key be restricted?  For X.509 certificates, these purposes should map to the key usage flags in X.509 Version 3 certificates.</li>

NOTE: See clause 10 of ISO/IEC 27002:2013 [i.3] for guidance.<br>  <br><b>ETSI EN 319 411-1 V1.2.1</b><br> 6.5.1 Key pair generation and installation<br> <br> OVR-6.5.1-01: The requirements identified in ETSI EN 319 401 [8], clause 7.5, shall apply.<br> <br> In addition the following particular requirements apply:<br> <br> GEN-6.5.1-02: The TSP shall generate CA keys, including keys used by revocation and registration services, securely and the private key shall be secret.<br>In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-03: The CA key pair generation and the subsequent certification of the public key, shall be undertaken in a physically secured environment (see clause 6.4.2) by personnel in trusted roles (see clause 6.4.4).</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-04: The CA key pair used for signing certificates shall be created under, at least, dual control.</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-05: The number of personnel authorized to carry out CA key pair generation shall be kept to a minimum and be consistent with the TSP's practices.</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-06: CA key pair generation should be performed using an algorithm as specified in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] for the CA's signing purposes. NOTE 1: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-07: The selected key length and algorithm for CA signing key should be one which is specified in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] for the CA's signing purposes. NOTE 2: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-08: Before expiration of its CA certificate which is used for signing subject keys (for example as indicated by expiration of CA certificate), in case of continuing with the service, the CA shall generate a new certificate for signing subject key pairs, and shall apply all necessary actions to avoid disruption to the operations of any entity that may rely on the CA certificate.</li>
        <li>GEN-6.5.1-09: Before expiration of its CA certificate which is used for signing subject keys (for example as indicated by expiration of CA certificate), in case of continuing with the service, the new CA certificate shall also be generated and distributed in accordance with the present document.
      </ul>
        GEN-6.5.1-10: The operations described in GEN-6.5.1-08 and GEN-6.5.1-09 should be performed with a suitable interval between certificate expiry date and the last certificate signed to allow all parties that have relationships with the TSP (subjects, subscribers, relying parties, CAs higher in the CA hierarchy, etc.) to be aware of this key changeover and to implement the required operations to avoid inconveniences and malfunctions. This does not apply to a TSP which will cease its operations before its own certificate-signing certificate expiration date.<br> <br>
        GEN-6.5.1-11: The TSP shall have a documented procedure for conducting CA key pair generation for certificate signing keys for all CAs, whether root CAs or subordinate CAs, including CAs that issue certificates to end users.<br> <br>
        GEN-6.5.1-12: The procedure of GEN-6.5.1-11 shall indicate, at least, the following:
        <ol  type="a">
          <li>roles participating in the ceremony (internal and external from the organization);</li>
          <li>functions to be performed by every role and in which phases;</li>
          <li>responsibilities during and after the ceremony; and</li>
          <li>requirements of evidence to be collected of the ceremony.</li>
        </ol>
        
        GEN-6.5.1-13: The TSP shall produce a report proving that the ceremony, as in GEN-6.5.1-11 above, was carried out in accordance with the stated procedure and that the integrity and confidentiality of the key pair was ensured.<br> <br>
        GEN-6.5.1-14: This report shall be signed [CHOICE]:
        <ul>
          <li>For root CA: by the trusted role responsible for the security of the TSP's key management ceremony (e.g. security officer) and a trustworthy person independent of the TSP's management (e.g. Notary, auditor) as<br>witness that the report correctly records the key management ceremony as carried out.</li>
          <li>For subordinate CAs: by the trusted role responsible for the security of the TSP's key management ceremony (e.g. security officer) as witness that the report correctly records the key management ceremony as carried out.</li>
        </ul>
          GEN-6.5.1-15 [PTC]: Clause 6.1.1.1 of the BRG [5] shall apply.<br> <br>
          DIS-6.5.1-16: CA signature verification (public) keys shall be available to relying parties in a manner that assures the integrity of the CA public key and authenticates its origin.<br> <br> NOTE 3: For example, CA public keys can be distributed in self-signed certificates, along with a declaration that the key authenticates the CA, or issued by another CA. By itself a self-signed certificate cannot be known to come from the CA. Additional measures, such as checking the fingerprint of the certificate against information provided by a trusted source, is needed to give assurance of the correctness of this certificate.<br> <br>

          <ul>
            <li> SDP-6.5.1-17 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, CA-generated subject keys shall be generated using an algorithm recognized as being fit for the uses identified in the CP during the validity time of the certificate.</li>

NOTE 4: Cryptographic suites recommendations defined in ETSI TS 119 312 [i.10] can be superseded by national recommendations.</li>
            <li>SDP-6.5.1-19 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys , CA-generated subject keys shall be generated and stored securely whilst held by the TSP.</li>
            <li>SDP-6.5.1-20 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the subject's private key shall be delivered to the subject's device or to the TSP managing the subject's private key, in a manner such that the secrecy and integrity of the key is not compromised.</li>
            <li>SDP-6.5.1-21 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys and if the TSP or any of its designated RAs become aware that a subject's private key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an organization not affiliated with the subject, then the TSP shall revoke all certificates that include the public key corresponding to the communicated private key.</li>
            <li>SDP-6.5.1-22 [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the CA shall delete all copies of a subject private key after delivery of the private key to the subject, except for conditions as described in clause 6.3.12.</li>
            <li>SDP-6.5.1-23 [NCP+] [CONDITIONAL]: If the CA generates the subject's keys, the TSP shall secure the issuance of a secure cryptographic device to the subject.</li>

Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls<br> <br> Requirements for private key protection and cryptographic modules need to be considered for the issuing CA, repositories, subject CAs, RAs, and subscribers.  For each of these types of entities, the following questions potentially need to be answered:
      <ol>
        <li>What standards, if any, are required for the cryptographic module used to generate the keys?  A cryptographic module can be composed of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination of them.  For example, are the keys certified by the infrastructure required to be generated using modules compliant with the US FIPS 140-1?  If so, what is the required FIPS 140-1 level of the module?  Are there any other engineering or other controls relating to a cryptographic module, such as the identification of the cryptographic module boundary, input/output, roles and services, finite state machine, physical security, software security, operating system security, algorithm compliance, electromagnetic compatibility, and self tests.</li>
        <li>Is the private key under n out of m multi-person control?(7)  If yes, provide n and m (two person control is a special case of n out of m, where n = m = 2)?</li>
        <li>Is the private key escrowed?(8)  If so, who is the escrow agent, what form is the key escrowed in (examples include plaintext, encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the escrow system?</li>
        <li>Is the private key backed up?  If so, who is the backup agent, what form is the key backed up in (examples include plaintext, encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the backup system?</li>
        <li>Is the private key archived?  If so, who is the archival agent, what form is the key archived in (examples include plaintext, encrypted, split key), and what are the security controls on the archival system?</li>
        <li>Under what circumstances, if any, can a private key be transferred into or from a cryptographic module?  Who is permitted to perform such a transfer operation?  In what form is the private key during the transfer (i.e., plaintext, encrypted, or split key)?</li>
        <li>How is the private key stored in the module (i.e., plaintext, encrypted, or split key)?</li>
        <li>Who can activate (use) the private key?  What actions must be performed to activate the private key (e.g., login, power on, supply PIN, insert token/key, automatic, etc.)?  Once the key is activated, is the key active for an indefinite period, active for one time, or active for a defined time period?</li>
        <li>Who can deactivate the private key and how?  Examples of methods of deactivating private keys include logging out, turning the power off, removing the token/key, automatic deactivation, and time expiration.</li>
        <li>Who can destroy the private key and how?  Examples of methods of destroying private keys include token surrender, token destruction, and overwriting the key.</li>
        <li>Provide the capabilities of the cryptographic module in the following areas: identification of the cryptographic module boundary, input/output, roles and services, finite state machine, physical security, software security, operating system security, algorithm compliance, electromagnetic compatibility, and self tests.
